# Cursor Talk to Figma MCP

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration between Cursor AI and Figma, allowing Cursor to communicate with Figma for reading designs and modifying them programmatically.

## Project Structure

- `src/talk_to_figma_mcp/` - TypeScript MCP server for Figma integration
- `src/cursor_mcp_plugin/` - Figma plugin for communicating with Cursor
- `src/socket.ts` - WebSocket server that facilitates communication between the MCP server and Figma plugin

## Get Started

1. Install Bun if you haven't already:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

2. Run setup, this will also install MCP in your Cursor's active project

```bash
bun setup
```

3. Start the Websocket server

```bash
bun socket
```

4. MCP server

```bash
bunx cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp
```

5. Install [Figma Plugin](#figma-plugin)

## Design Automation Example

**Bulk text content replacement**

Thanks to [@dusskapark](https://github.com/dusskapark) for contributing the bulk text replacement feature. Here is the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j05gGT3xfCs).

## Manual Setup and Installation

### MCP Server: Integration with Cursor

Add the server to your Cursor MCP configuration in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "TalkToFigma": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### WebSocket Server

Start the WebSocket server:

```bash
bun socket
```

### Figma Plugin

1. In Figma, go to Plugins > Development > New Plugin
2. Choose "Link existing plugin"
3. Select the `src/cursor_mcp_plugin/manifest.json` file
4. The plugin should now be available in your Figma development plugins

## Windows + WSL Guide

1. Install bun via powershell

```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

2. Uncomment the hostname `0.0.0.0` in `src/socket.ts`

```typescript
// uncomment this to allow connections in windows wsl
hostname: "0.0.0.0",
```

3. Start the websocket

```bash
bun socket
```

## Usage

1. Start the WebSocket server
2. Install the MCP server in Cursor
3. Open Figma and run the Cursor MCP Plugin
4. Connect the plugin to the WebSocket server by joining a channel using `join_channel`
5. Use Cursor to communicate with Figma using the MCP tools

## MCP Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools for interacting with Figma:

### Document & Selection

- `get_document_info` - Get information about the current Figma document
- `get_selection` - Get information about the current selection
- `read_my_design` - Get detailed node information about the current selection without parameters
- `get_node_info` - Get detailed information about a specific node
- `get_nodes_info` - Get detailed information about multiple nodes by providing an array of node IDs

### Annotations

- `get_annotations` - Get all annotations in the current document or specific node
- `set_annotation` - Create or update an annotation with markdown support
- `set_multiple_annotations` - Batch create/update multiple annotations efficiently
- `scan_nodes_by_types` - Scan for nodes with specific types (useful for finding annotation targets)

### Creating Elements

- `create_rectangle` - Create a new rectangle with position, size, and optional name
- `create_frame` - Create a new frame with position, size, and optional name
- `create_text` - Create a new text node with customizable font properties

### Modifying text content

- `scan_text_nodes` - Scan text nodes with intelligent chunking for large designs
- `set_text_content` - Set the text content of a single text node
- `set_multiple_text_contents` - Batch update multiple text nodes efficiently

### Styling

- `set_fill_color` - Set the fill color of a node (RGBA)
- `set_stroke_color` - Set the stroke color and weight of a node
- `set_corner_radius` - Set the corner radius of a node with optional per-corner control

### Layout & Organization

- `move_node` - Move a node to a new position
- `resize_node` - Resize a node with new dimensions
- `delete_node` - Delete a node
- `delete_multiple_nodes` - Delete multiple nodes at once efficiently
- `clone_node` - Create a copy of an existing node with optional position offset

### Components & Styles

- `get_styles` - Get information about local styles
- `get_local_components` - Get information about local components
- `create_component_instance` - Create an instance of a component

### Export & Advanced

- `export_node_as_image` - Export a node as an image (PNG, JPG, SVG, or PDF) - limited support on image currently returning base64 as text

### Connection Management

- `join_channel` - Join a specific channel to communicate with Figma

## Development

### Building the Figma Plugin

1. Navigate to the Figma plugin directory:

   ```
   cd src/cursor_mcp_plugin
   ```

2. Edit code.js and ui.html

## Best Practices

When working with the Figma MCP:

1. Always join a channel before sending commands
2. Get document overview using `get_document_info` first
3. Check current selection with `get_selection` before modifications
4. Use appropriate creation tools based on needs:
   - `create_frame` for containers
   - `create_rectangle` for basic shapes
   - `create_text` for text elements
5. Verify changes using `get_node_info`
6. Use component instances when possible for consistency
7. Handle errors appropriately as all commands can throw exceptions
8. For large designs:
   - Use chunking parameters in `scan_text_nodes`
   - Monitor progress through WebSocket updates
   - Implement appropriate error handling
9. For text operations:
   - Use batch operations when possible
   - Consider structural relationships
   - Verify changes with targeted exports
10. For converting legacy annotations:
    - Scan text nodes to identify numbered markers and descriptions
    - Use `scan_nodes_by_types` to find UI elements that annotations refer to
    - Match markers with their target elements using path, name, or proximity
    - Categorize annotations appropriately with `get_annotations`
    - Create native annotations with `set_multiple_annotations` in batches
    - Verify all annotations are properly linked to their targets
    - Delete legacy annotation nodes after successful conversion

## Quality Assurance Validation

The MCP integration includes an automated QA validation tool that helps ensure design consistency and adherence to design system rules. The validation tool checks each frame in your Figma document against a set of predefined QA rules and generates a detailed report.

### QA Rules Validated

- **Consistent page margins**: Checks that elements maintain proper margins (16px on mobile, 24px on tablet)
- **Typographic hierarchy**: Ensures there are fewer than 5 typographic styles per screen
- **Image positioning**: Verifies images extend to screen edges correctly
- **Bottom OS bar**: Checks that the bottom OS bar has proper background treatment
- **Vertical spacing**: Validates consistent spacing between cards, sections, and elements
- **Color contrast**: Ensures text meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 ratio)
- **UI language**: Verifies titles use sentence case rather than title case
- **Button usage**: Prevents overuse of buttons (no more than 2 per screen)
- **Corner radius**: Confirms all cards and images use consistent 6px corner radius
- **Card styling**: Ensures cards have proper drop shadows to indicate interactivity
- **Typeface**: Validates proper font family usage (Brown not Brandon)

### Running QA Validation

You can run QA validation through Cursor with:

```
// Validate all frames in the document
validate_qa_rules

// Validate specific frames
validate_qa_rules { "frameIds": ["123:456", "123:789"] }

// Customize output file
validate_qa_rules { "outputFilePath": "custom_report.txt" }
```

The validation will generate a detailed report file with pass/fail status for each rule, along with specific issues found.
